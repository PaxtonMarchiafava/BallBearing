# BallBearing
Python script for Fusion 360 that will create a 3 piece ball bearing with a single outer piece and 2 inside pieces, one being on the bottom and one being on top. 
The 2 pieces in the middle are in order to be able to put the balls in, then connect them so that nothing falls out. User interface that runs natively runs in fusion 360 
and will recieve parameters for construction is on it's way. It will be added when I learn how to make one.
